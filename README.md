## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned
I learnt how to build a presentable website for different screen rersolutions, and the build up of the site was achieved through the use of html codes as well as the css. At first the confusion on where to use margin and padding was telling seriously on me but i believe that constant practice will help me perfect my hand in the development of websites in the future to come.

```css
.music-img {
  background-image: url(./images/illustration-hero.svg);
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
  width: 450px;
  height: 220px;
  border-top-left-radius: 10px;
  border-top-right-radius: 10px;
}

and

@import url("https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Red+Hat+Display&display=swap");

body {
  font-family: "Red Hat Display", sans-serif;
  font-weight: 500, 700, 900;
  font-size: 16px;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  background-image: url(./images/pattern-background-desktop.svg);
  background-size: 100% 350%;
}
```
